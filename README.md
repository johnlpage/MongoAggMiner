# MongoAggMiner
Double Sha256 based Bitcoin Miner in MongoDB Aggregation

This was an experiment to see if I could get the MongoDB Aggregation Framework to verify a mined bitcoin block ( or to try different nonces in an attempt to mine one). It succeeded but it does 10 hashes/s so I wouldn't try using it to get rich. Current hardware does 10 TH/s Thats 10^12 (1 Billion) times faster :-)
