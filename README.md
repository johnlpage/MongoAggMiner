# MongoAggMiner
Double Sha256 based Bitcoin Miner in MongoDB Aggregation

This was an Experiment to see if I coudl get the Aggregation Dramework to verify a mined bitcoin block ( or to try different nonces to try an mine one). It succeeded but it does 10 hashes/s so I woudln't try using it to get rich.
